# Natural language processing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language

Tokenization
The process of breaking down text into individual units, or tokens, such as words or phrases, to facilitate analysis.

Stopword Removal
The elimination of common words (e.g., "and," "the," "is") that typically carry less meaningful information, allowing for more focused analysis.

Stemming
A technique that reduces words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" to "run") to treat different variations of a word as the same term.

Lemmatization
Similar to stemming, lemmatization reduces words to their base form, but it considers the context and converts words to their dictionary form (e.g., "better" to "good").

Text Cleaning
The process of removing unwanted characters, formatting, or noise from text data to improve its quality and usability for analysis.
